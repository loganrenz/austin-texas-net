# Content & Expansion Pillar — Austin-Texas.net

Austin-Texas.net grows through disciplined expansion, not random publishing. Every new page, tool, or guide must strengthen the authority structure and reinforce a core category. No isolated content. No trend-chasing without long-term value.

## Category-First Growth

All expansion ladders into existing hubs: **Food, Outdoors, Allergies, Events, Real Estate, Culture, Fun.** If a new idea doesn't clearly belong to one of these, it does not ship.

## High-Intent Queries Only

We prioritize searches that signal need:

- "Austin cedar pollen today"
- "Lake Travis water temp"
- "Best breakfast tacos Austin"
- "Austin events this weekend"

These are recurring, measurable, and monetizable.

## Evergreen > Viral

Seasonal content is allowed, but it must repeat annually (bluebonnets, ACL, cedar season). We avoid one-off news posts that decay instantly.

## Tool > Article

Where possible, build utilities instead of writing essays. Lists, filters, live panels, structured data, sortable directories — these compound value and rankings.

## Interlink Aggressively but Logically

Every new page links up to its category hub and laterally to related content. **No orphan pages.**

## Update Rhythm Matters

Freshness signals should be visible. If a guide requires updates, it must have an update cadence.

> The goal is **controlled compounding authority** — a growing ecosystem of structured Austin-specific assets that reinforce each other instead of diluting focus.
