# Content & Expansion Strategy — Austin-Texas.net

Austin-Texas.net grows through disciplined expansion, not random publishing. Every new page, tool, or guide must strengthen the authority structure and reinforce a core category. No isolated content. No trend-chasing without long-term value.

## Canonical Categories

All expansion ladders into these 11 hubs:

- **Food** — breakfast tacos, BBQ, coffee shops, food trucks, happy hours, restaurant map
- **Events** — this weekend, live music, festivals, family events, free events
- **Outdoors** — parks, hiking trails, swimming holes, Lake Travis, Barton Springs, trail map
- **Health** — cedar pollen, air quality, urgent care, flu activity, allergy map
- **Weather** — current conditions, radar, forecasts, heat index, freeze alerts, drought
- **More** — transportation, moving to Austin, jobs, schools, utilities, city services
- **Live Data** — water temps, lake levels, traffic map, power outages, AQI, river flow
- **Real Estate** — market trends, median home prices, property tax, new developments, rent
- **Neighborhoods** — Downtown, South Congress, East Austin, Mueller, Round Rock, Cedar Park
- **Culture** — museums, street art, history, local brands, film & media, iconic Austin
- **Fun** — mini games, date ideas, kid activities, scenic drives, photo spots, weekend guides

If a new idea doesn't clearly belong to one of these (or to a Radar-validated new category), it does not ship.

## Visual Identity per Category

Each category gets its own **visual identity** drawn from the rope-letter logo system:

- Dedicated illustrated header element for the category landing page
- Thematic icons that reference Austin culture (not generic vector icons)
- Consistent accent color from the brand palette
- These visual elements carry through to social preview cards and OG images

This visual identity makes each category feel like its own destination while belonging to a unified brand.

## Radar-Driven Expansion

The **Radar module** is the internal SEO intelligence engine that identifies:

- **Gaps** in existing category coverage (e.g., Health has cedar but not oak pollen)
- **New category opportunities** with validated search demand
- **Seasonal windows** (bluebonnets, ACL, cedar season, SXSW)

No new category is created without Radar-backed demand signals. Every new category follows the same hub → child page architecture and gets its own visual identity treatment.

## High-Intent Queries Only

We prioritize searches that signal need:

- "Austin cedar pollen today"
- "Lake Travis water temp"
- "Best breakfast tacos Austin"
- "Austin events this weekend"
- "Austin median home price"
- "Things to do in Austin this weekend"
- "Austin weather radar"

These are recurring, measurable, and monetizable.

## Evergreen > Viral

Seasonal content is allowed, but it must repeat annually (bluebonnets, ACL, cedar season). We avoid one-off news posts that decay instantly.

## Tool > Article

Where possible, build utilities instead of writing essays. Lists, filters, live panels, structured data, sortable directories — these compound value and rankings.

## Interlink Aggressively but Logically

Every new page links up to its category hub and laterally to related content. **No orphan pages.**

## Update Rhythm Matters

Freshness signals should be visible. If a guide requires updates, it must have an update cadence.

> The goal is **controlled compounding authority** — a growing ecosystem of structured Austin-specific assets that reinforce each other, look unmistakably like Austin-Texas.net, and compound value instead of diluting focus.
