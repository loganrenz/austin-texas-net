# Core UI Values — Austin-Texas.net

The UI must communicate clarity, control, and intention from the first scroll. Nothing should feel accidental, decorative, or filler. Every visual element exists to support utility.

## Clarity Over Cleverness

Navigation must be obvious. Categories must feel structured. Users should immediately understand where they are and what they can do next. No ambiguous labels. No buried actions. No surprise interactions.

## Utility-First Design

This is not a magazine. It is a functional local platform. Live data, guides, and tools must feel actionable. If something is labeled "Live," it should feel dynamic and current. If something is "Coming Soon," it must feel deliberate — not broken.

## Consistency Builds Trust

Cards follow the same format. Status badges behave the same everywhere. Spacing, typography, icon style, and hover states must be predictable. Inconsistency signals immaturity. Predictability signals platform-level thinking.

## Speed as a Design Principle

Fast load times are part of the brand. Minimal visual noise. No bloated components. Performance and simplicity reinforce credibility.

## Hierarchy Is Visible

Typography scale must clearly differentiate H1, H2, and H3. Sections should breathe. The page should scan easily in under 10 seconds.

## Calm, Local, Modern Aesthetic

Color palette should feel Austin but not gimmicky. Confident, clean, slightly tech-forward — not touristy.

> The UI should feel like a **structured control panel for the city** — not a content blog. Every design choice should reinforce usefulness, scalability, and long-term authority.
