# Austin-Texas.net — What We Are Building

Austin-Texas.net is a bold, illustrated, local-first platform designed to become the most useful real-time utility layer for people living in or visiting Austin. It is not a blog, not a generic directory, and not a content farm. It is the **digital front porch of Austin** — confident, deeply local, slightly loud, but always structured and fast.

## The Brand

The rope-letter logo — with its Texas star, cowboy hat, Austin skyline, taco, guitar, bridge, beer, and bat — is the **core brand expression**. Every design decision flows from this illustrated identity. The site celebrates Austin culture visually and refuses to water itself down into sterile SaaS minimalism.

Austin-Texas.net looks and feels like Austin: expressive, iconic, warm, and alive.

## The Goal

Centralize high-intent Austin searches — pollen levels, water temperatures, food spots, events, neighborhoods, seasonal happenings — into a fast, trustworthy ecosystem that feels unmistakably Texan. Every section must serve a practical purpose. **If it doesn't solve a real, recurring need, it doesn't belong.**

## Category Architecture

Internal linking and breadcrumb structure are core ranking mechanisms, not decorative UI.

The site is organized into **11 canonical hub categories**, each with deep child pages:

- **Food** — breakfast tacos, BBQ, coffee shops, food trucks, happy hours, restaurant map
- **Events** — this weekend, live music, festivals, family events, free events
- **Outdoors** — parks, hiking trails, swimming holes, Lake Travis, Barton Springs, trail map
- **Health** — cedar pollen, air quality, urgent care, flu activity, allergy map
- **Weather** — current conditions, radar, forecast, heat index, freeze alerts, drought
- **More** — transportation, moving to Austin, jobs, schools, utilities, city services
- **Live Data** — water temps, lake levels, traffic map, power outages, AQI, river flow
- **Real Estate** — market trends, median home prices, property tax, new developments, rent
- **Neighborhoods** — Downtown, South Congress, East Austin, Mueller, Round Rock, Cedar Park
- **Culture** — museums, street art, history, local brands, film & media, iconic Austin
- **Fun** — mini games, date ideas, kid activities, scenic drives, photo spots, weekend guides

New categories are added through **Radar analysis** — our internal SEO intelligence engine that identifies high-intent gaps and validates demand before we build. Every new category must follow the same hub → child pattern.

## The Homepage

The homepage is a **confident, illustrated entry point to Austin**. It leads with the rope-letter brand and uses strong visual language — thematic icons, bold section headers, and illustrated touches that reference the logo system. It is still ruthlessly functional: a link directory at heart, but one that looks and feels like a love letter to the city.

The homepage must:

- Lead with the rope-letter logo and a bold, confident hero that sets the tone
- Use illustrated section headers or thematic iconography per category
- Present all 11 categories in a visually consistent card grid
- Provide quick-access links to every major sub-page
- Optionally surface real-time data (pollen, water temps) as compact live indicators
- Feel alive — micro-animations, hover interactions, skeleton loading
- Stay structured — no bloat, no walls of text, just clear paths to deep content

## Core Principles

- **Celebrate Austin culture visually.** The rope aesthetic is the brand anchor. Lean into it.
- **Strong illustrated headers.** Each major section gets visual identity from the logo system.
- **Thematic iconography per category.** Icons and accents should feel like they belong to Austin.
- **Speed matters.** Fast load times are non-negotiable. Personality does not mean performance debt.
- **Clean hierarchy.** Crawl clarity, reading flow, and structured navigation are sacred.
- **SEO discipline.** Architecture precedes content. Structure is the product.
- **No inflated claims. No SEO spam. No content without structure.**
- **Do NOT water it down. Do NOT revert to sterile SaaS minimalism.**

## Radar-Driven Expansion

The **Radar module** is the internal pipeline for controlled growth. It continuously analyzes Austin-related search queries to identify:

- Gaps in existing category coverage
- New category opportunities with validated demand
- Seasonal content windows (bluebonnets, ACL, cedar season, SXSW)

No new category ships without Radar-backed justification.

## The End State

A cohesive network of Austin-specific tools and guides that:

- Rank organically for high-intent local queries
- Interlink intelligently across the authority pyramid
- Feel intentional, expressive, and trustworthy at every layer
- Look unmistakably like Austin — not like another city's site with the name swapped

**We are building the foundation correctly so expansion becomes compounding, not chaotic. And we are building it with personality — because Austin has personality.**
