  - question: 'How do I get around Austin without a car?'

  - question: 'What should I know before moving to Austin?'
    answer: 'Key considerations include: the heat (summers are brutal), allergies (cedar fever is real), traffic (I-35 congestion is legendary), cost of living (rising but still below coastal cities), and the incredible food/music/outdoor scene that makes it all worth it.'
  - question: 'How do Austin utilities work?'
    answer: 'Austin Energy provides electricity, Austin Water handles water service, and Texas Gas Service provides natural gas. Most residents set up accounts through the City of Austin utilities portal. Electric rates vary seasonally with higher summer costs due to cooling demand.'
