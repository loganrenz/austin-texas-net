## Keep Austin Weird

"Keep Austin Weird" isn't just a bumper sticker — it's a cultural manifesto. Austin's identity is built on **creative independence, artistic expression, and a welcoming embrace of the unconventional**. From the massive murals that cover entire building facades to the gently haunted history walking tours downtown, Austin's culture is as vibrant as its music scene.

## Street Art & Murals

Austin is one of America's most prolific street art cities. The **"Greetings from Austin" postcard mural** on South First Street is the city's most iconic — so much so that it's survived multiple relocations. But that's just the beginning. Entire districts like **East Austin, South Congress, and the HOPE Outdoor Gallery (RIP)** are open-air galleries featuring works by local and international artists.

Our street art map catalogs **hundreds of murals, graffiti walls, and public art installations** across the city, with photos, artist credits, and GPS coordinates. It's the perfect tool for a self-guided art walk or finding the right backdrop for that Austin photo.

## Haunted Austin

Austin has a darker side that most tourists never see. The **Driskill Hotel**, built in 1886, is considered one of the most haunted hotels in Texas. The **Littlefield House** on the UT campus has a storied history of ghostly encounters. And the **Moonlight Towers** — Austin's 165-foot-tall Victorian streetlights, the only ones remaining in the world — were originally erected in part because of a serial killer terrorizing the city in the 1880s.

## The Creative Economy

Austin's creative culture isn't just aesthetic — it's economic. The city is home to a thriving arts community including **film production, independent publishing, game development, and design studios**. Annual events like East Austin Studio Tour (EAST) open hundreds of private studios to the public, revealing the creative engine that keeps Austin weird.
