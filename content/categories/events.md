## The Live Music Capital of the World

Austin isn't just nicknamed the **Live Music Capital of the World** — it lives up to that title every single night. With over 300 live music venues, the city hosts more live music per capita than any other city in America. From legendary stages like the Continental Club and Stubbs to tiny dive bars on East 6th, there's always a show happening somewhere.

The city's music scene spans every genre imaginable: blues and country on South Congress, indie rock on Red River, jazz in the Warehouse District, hip-hop on the east side, and genre-defying experimental acts everywhere in between. Our live music tracker helps you find tonight's shows by genre, venue, or neighborhood.

## Beyond Music

**Rodeo Austin** is a beloved annual tradition running each March. Combining a professional rodeo, carnival, BBQ cook-off, and concert series, it's one of the city's biggest events and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors. The livestock show and star exhibit are highlights for families.

**Chicken Sh\*t Bingo** at the Little Longhorn Saloon is peak Austin weirdness — and we mean that as the highest compliment. Every Sunday afternoon, a live chicken wanders across a numbered bingo board in the back of a honky-tonk bar. When it does its business on your number, you win. It's free, it's absurd, and it's absolutely essential Austin.

## The Austin Calendar

Austin's event calendar is packed year-round. **SXSW** (March) takes over downtown with music, film, and tech. **ACL Fest** (October) brings headliners to Zilker Park. **Trail of Lights** (December) transforms the park into a holiday wonderland. And countless smaller events — art walks, food festivals, outdoor movie screenings — fill the gaps between the big ones.
