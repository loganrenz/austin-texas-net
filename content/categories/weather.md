## Austin Weather

Austin's weather is defined by **hot summers, mild winters, and dramatic swings** in between. Central Texas sits at the crossroads of Gulf moisture, Great Plains cold fronts, and desert heat — a combination that produces everything from perfect spring days to severe thunderstorms to extended summer heat waves.
